## ColorPresets
A full re-implementation of the color presets system made using BSML and BSIPA.

## What is this mod?
This mod completely remakes the existing color preset system in order to add more features, such as:

- Removing the limit of only being able to store 5 color presets at once.
- Importing color presets from beatmaps. **(yet to be implemented)**
- Easy saving and sharing using json files to store presets.

## Installation
Download the latest release and place the .dll file inside your plugins folder
